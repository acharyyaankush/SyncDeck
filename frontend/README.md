# SyncDeck 🚀 

**A Full-Stack, Real-Time Interactive Presentation Platform**

SyncDeck is a powerful web-based presentation tool built for the modern remote era. It allows a "Presenter" to create, edit, and arrange slides in real-time while "Viewers" follow along instantly. Featuring a custom drag-and-drop canvas engine and live socket synchronization.



## ✨ Key Features

* **Live Synchronization:** Powered by Socket.io, every change made by the presenter (text, image, color, or layout) is reflected on all viewers' screens with sub-second latency.
* **Dynamic Canvas Engine:** Presenters can freely move and resize text boxes and images using a "Snap-to-Grid" system for professional alignment.
* **Rich Text Editing:** Integrated Word-like formatting (Bold, Italic, Lists) using React Quill.
* **On-the-Fly Customization:** Toggle content areas (Text/Image) and change background colors instantly via a transparent control panel.
* **Smart Shortcuts:** Navigate slides with arrow keys and use keyboard shortcuts for a desktop-app feel.
* **Image Uploads:** Instant local file processing and synchronization without external storage dependencies.
